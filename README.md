# Which book can attract anyone towards your field of study?

_(Inspired and seeded by info in [this]( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30822339) hackernews thread)_

If you were to choose one book (or maybe more than one :P) to lure a curious person to your field of study, which will you choose?

It has to be _**inviting for someone that knows nothing about the field**_ but becomes hooked after reading it. Not some epitome which is revered by experts only.
